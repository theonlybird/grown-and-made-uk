  /**
   * Query expansion and candidate scoring.
   *
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * IMPORTANT: the whole of this file is inlined verbatim into api/ai-search.js
   * by scripts/update-search-api.js. It must stay dependency-free and must not
   * reference anything outside the `lexicon` object handed to it. Everything
   * below the EXPORTS marker is stripped during that copy.
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * Why this exists
   *
   * The tagging side has always had a careful vocabulary: `sausage` is a
   * `pork & bacon` product, `cider` is `drinks & spirits`. The search side had
   * none. It compared the user's words against the tag LABELS, so a search for
   * "sausages" never met the tag "pork & bacon" and scored zero — the query then
   * fell through to a padded shortlist of whatever sat first in the file, and the
   * model quite reasonably reported no results.
   *
   * So: run the query through the same lexicon that produced the tags, and match
   * canonical tag against canonical tag.
   *
   * Three deliberate differences from tagging:
   *
   *   1. NO NOISE STRIPPING. NOISE exists because "Whiskey Nubuck" is a colour
   *      and "Honey Cream" is a polish — problems that only arise in a shop's own
   *      product titles. A person who types "honey" means honey. Stripping the
   *      query would delete the search term.
   *
   *   2. HEAD-NOUN SUPPRESSION IS KEPT. "cake tin" is still a tin when someone
   *      searches for it, so the modifier rule earns its place on both sides.
   *
   *   3. QUERY_EXTRA IS ADDED. Kitchen-table words ("bangers", "spuds", "a joint
   *      of beef") never appear in a product feed, so they must not influence
   *      tagging — but they are exactly what people type.

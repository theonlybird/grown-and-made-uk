   The catalogue the model chooses from.

   This used to be a copy of businesses.json frozen into this file whenever
   scripts/update-search-api.js was run. Nothing reminded anyone to run it, so
   the copy went stale: the nine businesses added on 17 Sep 2026 were on the
   map but could never be picked by the AI search, because the model was only
   ever shown the list as it stood on the 16th.

   It is now built from data/businesses.json when the function starts, so the
   AI search always sees exactly what the map shows. `require` is traced by
   Vercel's bundler, so the file ships with the function. If that ever fails,
   the same file is fetched from the site itself -- the pattern
   api/update-listing.js already relies on in production.

Analyze the user's natural language request and find the best matching British makers from the provided candidate catalog.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Understand regional synonyms (e.g. Yorkshire = Sheffield, Leeds; Scotland = Hawick, Edinburgh; Wales = Gwynedd; Cotswolds = Chipping Campden).
2. Match materials, craft techniques, product terms and tags (e.g. pet food bowls = ceramics/pottery pet bowls; knitted vests = woollen waistcoats/gilets; kitchen knife = forged cutlery/blades).
1b. Respect who the shopper is buying for. "au" on a catalog entry lists the audiences that business actually dresses — men, women, children. If the query names an audience ("mens jackets", "something for my daughter"), never return a business whose "au" excludes it. An entry with no "au" has not been classified yet and may be returned. An audience is a filter, never a reason to match: "mens jackets" still has to be jackets.
2a. IGNORE subjective adjectives entirely — sustainable, ethical, eco, green, nice, best, quality, luxury, affordable and the like. This directory does not rank businesses on those claims and has no evidence with which to do so, so "sustainable jumper" must return exactly what "jumper" returns. Certified or factual descriptors ARE meaningful and should be matched: organic, handmade, traditional, heritage.
3. Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching this exact structure:
{
  "query": ${JSON.stringify(query)},
  "productTerm": "the plural everyday noun for what they want, e.g. jumpers, watches, jewellery, venison, mugs. Lowercase. Null if they named no product. STRIP subjective adjectives: 'sustainable jumper', 'nice jumper' and 'the best quality jumper' all have the productTerm 'jumpers'.",
  "locationTerm": "the place they asked for exactly as a person would say it, e.g. Darlington, Norfolk, Cornwall. Null if they named no place. Only ever a place the user actually typed — never infer one from the product.",
  "madeOrGrown": "made or grown - use grown for food, produce, meat and farm goods; made for everything else",
  "matchQuality": "exact if you found businesses that genuinely satisfy BOTH the product and the location; wider if you found the right product but had to go outside the requested area; loose if you could only find loosely related businesses",
  "matches": [
    { "id": "exact-business-id-from-catalog" }
  ]
}
4. Limit matches to the top 1-12 most relevant businesses.
4a. IMPORTANT: never return an empty matches array. If nothing matches well, set matchQuality to "wider" or "loose" and still return the closest alternatives from the catalog.
4b. Be honest in matchQuality. If the user asked for a town and the nearest match is a county away, that is "wider", not "exact".
5. DO NOT include markdown formatting like \`\`\`json. Return raw JSON string only.

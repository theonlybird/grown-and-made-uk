"""Apply approved listing updates to businesses.json.

    python3 scripts/apply-submissions.py ~/Downloads/approved-submissions.json [--dry-run]

The admin page approves; this applies. Keeping them apart means every change to
the dataset still arrives as a git diff you can read and revert, rather than a
web form writing to the live data.

Only allow-listed fields are written, and only where the record still holds the
value the business was shown. If someone edited that field in between, the
change is reported as a conflict and skipped rather than silently overwriting
newer work.

A dragged pin IS applied on approval -- the business chose where it goes, you
approved it, and lat/lng are checked server-side for being real UK coordinates.

Tier appeals are never applied automatically -- they are listed for you to
judge against the rulebook, which is the whole point of keeping Gold
non-discretionary. Removals are listed too, since deleting a record is not
something a script should decide.

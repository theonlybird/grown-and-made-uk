/**
 * Merge the harvested product index into businesses.json.
 *
 * The harvest and the rescore both ran, but only a fraction of the result was
 * ever merged into the file search actually reads. Pipers Farm has twelve tags
 * in the index and shipped one; Gazegill has twelve and shipped three. This
 * closes that gap.
 *
 * Rules, in the order they are applied:
 *
 *   1. HAND TAGS ARE NEVER DROPPED. Anything already on the business that the
 *      harvester could not have produced (`fresh meat`, `farm shop & deli`) is
 *      editorial and outranks anything scraped.
 *
 *   2. STRONG TAGS ARE TAKEN AS THEY COME. A strong tag is one the shop itself
 *      filed under that product_type. That is the shop's own claim about its
 *      own goods, which is the best evidence available short of asking them.
 *
 *   3. WEAK TAGS NEED CORROBORATION. A weak tag is inferred from free-text
 *      product titles, and a single title is thin: one "Beef Dripping Candle"
 *      should not make a chandler into a beef farm. The rescore report flagged
 *      this and asked for a count threshold once counts existed. They exist
 *      now, so: at least MIN_WEAK_PRODUCTS distinct products must support it.
 *
 *   4. WEAK TAGS ARE RE-TESTED AGAINST THEIR OWN EVIDENCE. The index was built
 *      under an older noise list, and a weak tag's stored evidence IS the
 *      product title that produced it — so it can simply be re-read under
 *      today's rules. This is what catches "Big Green Egg" being filed as eggs
 *      (it is a barbecue), "Duck Fat Yorkshire Puddings" as poultry, and
 *      "Whipped Tallow Butter" as dairy. All three were live in the index.
 *
 *   5. CATEGORY GATING STILL APPLIES, belt and braces — a Stoke pottery cannot
 *      acquire "fruit & veg" here any more than it could during tagging.
 *
 * Also stamps `products_checked` so a stale tag can be seen to be stale rather
 * than quietly presented as current.
 *
 * SCOPE. By default only food and drink tags are merged. The harvested tags
 * for clothing describe what a shop STOCKS, not what it MAKES — Sub Zero's
 * feed yields "bags & leather goods" off a Lifeventure boot bag, and Budd
 * would gain "dresses" and "umbrellas" it has never made. The map's claim is
 * about making, so those need editorial review before they ship. For a farm
 * shop the distinction does not arise: stocking cheese is exactly what makes
 * it the right answer to "where can I buy cheese".
 *
 * SHARED FEEDS ARE SKIPPED. Four potters are listed with a page on the
 * Contemporary Ceramics Centre as their website, so the harvester read the
 * gallery's whole shop four times over: every one of them came back with the
 * same hundred products and the same tags. Those tags describe the gallery's
 * stock, not the potter's work. Any feed that two or more listings share is
 * therefore left alone, whoever the listings are.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/merge-product-index.js [--dry-run] [--groups=food,drink]
 *                                             [--skip=id,id]

// really does weave linen tableware, and David Mellor really does make it.
